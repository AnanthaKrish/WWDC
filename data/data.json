      "details": "Why is it called the Beard Bash?\n\nQuite simple because I have a big beard and it seemed like a fun name.\n\nDo I need a beard to attend?\n\nLOL, no. The party is open to developers in town during WWDC, although space is limited.\n\nWhy do you have a party?\n\nIâ€™ve been doing this party for the last six years as a way to say thanks to developers for all the hard work they do. Itâ€™s a night where they donâ€™t have to worry about anything, just having a good time.\n\nWill there be music?\n\nOh yes! We have a band play every year. This will be a concert party with great music!\n\nDo I need a ticket?\n\nYes. Tickets are free, but you will need to RSVP in order to attend the party. The process is very simpleâ€”we will make an announcement on how to RSVP as we get closer to WWDC.\n\nCan I bring a friend?\n\nIf your friend registers for a ticket, sure ðŸ™‚\n\nWill alcohol be served?\n\nYes, beer (lots of Heineken) and wine will be free. Mixed drinks can be purchased. There will also be non-alcoholic beverages available.\n\nDo I need to be 21 years old to attend?\n\nNo, this is an all ages party. If you would like to drink, you will need to show your ID to get a wrist band.\n\nWhere and when will the party be held?\n\nThe party is being held at the City National Civic Center in San Joseâ€”directly across the street from WWDC. The event will be on \nMonday, June 5, 2017 from 8 pm -12 am.\n\nIs the party sponsored?\n\nYes we have a number of companies that sponsor the party. There are limited sponsorship spots available, but if you are interested please email me directly.",
