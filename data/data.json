Hosts from Connected will be joined by Serenity Caldwell and Jason Snell.\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\nYes. The event will include an open bar, and as such, is ages 21 and up. You will be required to show an ID to enter.\nWill I be able to touch Myke's beard?\nNo. Well, maybe. (Did we mention there's an open bar?)\nWhat if I can't make it?\nWhile that question makes us sad, we will be releasing the audio of the panel as that week's Connected episode. But you can't touch Myke's beard through your podcast player.\n\nWHEN\nMonday, June 13, 2016 from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM (PDT) - Add to Calendar\nWHERE\n111 Minna Gallery - 111 Minna Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 - View Map",
