This year we’re partnering with AltConf to bring the first AltBeard Bash to be held Tuesday, June 3, 2014 from 7-11 at the Children’s Creativity Museum at Moscone, 221 4th St, San Francisco.\n\nOne of the big changes this year is that we are opening the party up to all attendees. We will still be sending out a few invites (because we like them), but entry into the party will be on a first come, first serve basis. There will be a cash bar at the party so you can grab a drink and enjoy some music.\n\nSpeaking of music, The Amazing Embarrassonics Human Karaoke Machine will be back to entertain you—and let you entertain your fellow developers. They are the best live band karaoke around, so come to the party and be prepared to sing and have fun.",

Johnson, this lively evening will feature a number of special guests from back in the day, including former solidThinking developer and current VP of Tools at Pixar Guido Quaroni, ur-NeXTSTEP developer Andy Stone, and several others too shy to let us give out their names (some of whom might work at a local fruit company).\n\nThere will be a bunch of NeXTStations running NeXTSTEP 3.3 or OpenStep 4.2 (including a rare HP workstation) along with lots of third-party software from back in the day as well as the folks who wrote it. We've also heard rumors that there may be a VMware version of NeXTSTEP 3.3 and OpenStep 4.2, but we can neither confirm nor deny.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nmusical entertainment courtesy of our friend James Dempsey.\nrarely seen photos from photographer Doug Menuez. Steve Jobs commissioned to shoot all internal NeXT events back at the beginning - http://www.menuez.com\nChris Coleman from 20 Wines will be pouring awesome California vintages (in his signature ammo cases, of course).\na local SF food truck, hearty beer from Thirsty Bear, some choice tequila and whiskey options, and a variety of non-alchoholic drinks.\nthe museum's current exhibitions, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pretty in Ink: The Trina Robbins Collection.\nThere are even rumors of a raffle/auction with some interesting NeXT \u0026 Pixar items, but this is entirely unconfirmed at this time. If there was such a thing, it would only be available to ticket holders...\n\nTickets \u0026 Event Info\n\nTickets are priced at $200 each, and include entry to the event, plus a personalized NeXTEVNT ID badge. The ID badge can help identify you amongst other NeXTEVNT guests, and will include your Twitter username (or first name if you prefer), company name, and a small sentence describing a funny story about your experience with NeXT or fun fact.\n\nThis event starts at 4 p.m. to allow you plenty of time to enjoy the museum and chill before eating, drinking, and listening to our speakers. We want this event to be about hanging out and chatting, which is what we heard that folks most enjoyed last year.\n\nEvent Sponsorship\n\nWe’re looking for sponsors to help fund this event. The sponsorship will pay for the food \u0026 drink for the event, plus help sponsor some educational programs for kids. In return we’re offering 3 levels of sponsorship:\n\nPlatinum – $2,000 (4 tickets \u0026 company logo printed on the ID badge (Front Side))\nGold – $1,000 (2 tickets \u0026 large company logo printed on the ID badge (Back Side))\nSilver – $500 (1 ticket \u0026 small company logo printed on the ID badge (Back Side))\nTax Deductions\n\nPlease note that most of the ticket price for this event is tax deductible.

The museum was started by a group of cartoonists and collectors who wanted to share their appreciation of this unique art form with the rest of the world.

We want to be a small group to be able to chat a little, early but not too early. Good for early-birds and jet-laggers.\nOh, and did we mention that it's a free breakfast for you? Yup, this breakfast of champions is sponsored by Appsfire, app growth engine since 2009.\nIn case you can't join us on June 5th, or if this event is full, try this other event on June 3rd.",

Email adventure (at) discoveraero.com with subject 'Clue' to find out where you can get yours.\n\nWinners will be drawn and announced on this site and social media by 9PM Wednesday evening.\n\nWHY\nThe AERO Adventure gives conference goers the opportunity to dabble with iBeacon, CoreBluetooth and micro-location with the intent of giving everyone a little exercise and taking in just a small part of what San Francisco offers.\n\nOr if you prefer... because it's fun! Duh.\nRULES\nNo cost to participate\nNo registration required\nOne submission per person*\nSubmit solution to adventure ( at ) discoveraero.com\nAttendance not required at either venue to participate or win\nPlease be respectful of other people and property\nNo moving, possessing or tampering physically or digitally of AERO Adventure beacons\nPlease have fun and be safe!\n \n* The answer will be obvious so no need to guess\nET CETERA\nSubmisions\nA minimum submission should include the subject 'Solved' with the body containing the solution to the puzzle. Please include a valid email if different than what you are sending with. Any additional information is optional but helpful in establishing contact in the event of winning a prize. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share personal information without consent.\n \nPrizes\nSubmissions with the correct solution will be drawn randomly except for the First Solved Prize which will be awarded to the first person to correctly solve the puzzle. The First Solved winner will still be placed in the random drawing.\nFirst Solved: $50\nFirst Place: $100\nSecond Place: $70\nThird Place: $30\n \nClue\nEach AERO Adventure beacon will display a different number when scanned. This will be important in solving the puzzle.\n \nApps\nThe AERO Adventure beacons will make use of two services within iOS for Bluetooth Low Energy;\nFirst, iBeacon is used for anyone wishing to utilize an iBeacon app for receiving notifications when in range of a beacon during the hunt. The Proximity UUID for all beacons will be E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0 which is an iOS test ID that should be recognized by most current iBeacon apps. The Major ID will be 108 and the Minor ID will be the number of the beacon as per its Display Name.\nSecond, you can manually scan for beacons along the way using CoreBluetooth scanners such as BLExplr, LightBlue and others. Search for BLE or BTLE in the app store.\n \nWWDC\nThe AERO Adventure is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Apple or WWDC. It is our sincere intention to enhance NOT to disrupt WWDC in any way. No AERO Adventure beacons will be in or on the Moscone West campus. As such it is expected that all adventurers will refrain from searching, scanning or otherwise playing the game while attending the conference. However, what you do outside of the Moscone West conference walls on your own time is your choice.\nMany Happy Adventures!\n~ The AERO Team",
